#uses the multilingual list of the Worlds International Ornithological Congress (IOC) Bird List: https://worldbirdnames.org/Multiling%20IOC%2015.1_c.xlsx
# it should correspond well to the bird net taxons because they use the ebird taxonomy which is based on the IOC taxonomy

import pandas as pd

file = pd.read_excel("Multiling IOC 15.1_c.xlsx")

lex.set_index('IOC_15.1', inplace=True)

#only problem: since it is an World List --> creating dataframe and searching for one species takes around 15 s (on my hardware)
